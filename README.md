# BR-Dep.-Reimbursement-Requests
Analyzing Brazillian Deputies Reimbursement Requests
Project done for the Data Scientist path in Codecademy
Here we utilized several tools to visualize and analyse tendencies in expenditure among Brazillian deputies over 12 years.
We were able to observe how expenses follow a trend associated with local and federal elections.
By implementing RandomForestClassifier, a Machine Learning model, I was able to draw some correlation (53%, 3 classes) between, year, value of expense, region of representation, and
expense justification with one of three classes: left wing, center, and right political view associated with the deputy's political party.
After that, we applied a Deep Neural Network (DNN) which performed worse than the RandomForestClassifier. It came as a surprise which since DNN are known for performing better
than any other Machine Learning Model.
Further Investigation will be done and updates will follow.
